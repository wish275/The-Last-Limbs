# The-Last-Limbs
Hey guys! So this game is pretty simple. There is a stickman (yes, a stickman), and you have to get him/her (you can name it if you want!) through 4 levels to reach freedom (which is also seen as a green box). The way it sacrifices something is that if you hit an obstacle (which is seen as a red box), it loses a part of its limb.
